        T n C's FOR OUR DISPATCH SERVICE

1. Our riders will only pick up from your pickup location and deliver at the delivery location without involving any third party i.e.

(a) Rider won't wait for you to confirm payment for item before delivery. You're expected to have concluded payment with other party before we send our rider over

(b) Rider won't be in communication with anyone apart from me, so don't ask me for riders number. You're to run every transaction through me, either via WhatsApp or call

2. Payment before delivery. Once your payment is confirmed, your order will be placed.

3. Our delivery fees can vary from time to time, depending on a lot of factors including but not limited to distance, weather, time availability of rider and so on.

4. Always share evidence of payment made on WhatsApp. It's only after payment is confirmed that your pickup/delivery order will be made.
